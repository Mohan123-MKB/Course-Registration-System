🌐 RESTful API for Real-World Entities

Welcome to the **RESTful API for Real-World Entities** – a backend application built with **Spring Boot** and **MySQL** that demonstrates how to manage real-life data through clean, scalable REST APIs.
This project focuses on managing three core entities: **Students**, **Courses**, and **Enrollments**, providing full CRUD operations and relational mapping. It’s a great learning tool for understanding layered architecture, REST principles, and backend integration with databases.
Whether you're building a learning platform, student portal, or simply want to master API design — this project serves as a practical foundation.
